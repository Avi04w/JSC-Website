<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway system is a critical part
of Toronto’s public transportation network, servicing over a million
riders daily across multiple lines. However, subway delays have been a
persistent issue, impacting the efficiency and reliability of the
service. Understanding the primary causes of these delays and how they
vary by time of day and across different subway lines is essential for
improving service quality and enhancing passenger experience.</p>
<p>This study aims to investigate the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are the primary causes of subway delays in Toronto and how do
these delays vary by subway line/station?</li>
<li>Can we estimate the duration of subway delays across Toronto’s TTC
system based on different predictors?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hypothesis 1:</strong> Mechanical issues are the most common
causes of subway delays in Toronto.</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis 2:</strong> Delays are more frequent during peak
hours (7-9 AM and 3-7 PM) compared to non-peak hours.</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis 3:</strong> The Yonge-University line experiences
more frequent delays than other lines due to higher passenger volumes
and longer track lengths. Bloor-Yonge and Union stations will have the
most and longest delays on this line since they are the most crowded
stations in terms of ridership.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> I believe that the model we fit to
predict length of delays will depend on: station, type of delay, hour of
day, and weather.</li>
</ul>
<p>To address these questions and test the hypotheses, we will utilize
the TTC Subway Delay Data provided by the City of Toronto’s Open Data
portal as well as the Open-Meteo API to get Toronto weather data. The
TTC dataset contains detailed information on delay incidents for the
year 2024, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delay Codes</strong> and their descriptions indicating the
reasons for delays.</li>
<li><strong>Time Stamp Information</strong> such as date, time, and day
of the week.</li>
<li><strong>Location Details</strong> including the station and subway
line affected.</li>
<li><strong>Duration of Delays</strong> measured in minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data was acquired using the City’s Open Data API. By exploring
and analyzing this dataset, we seek to identify patterns and trends in
delay causes, assess peak times for delays, and determine if specific
lines and/or stations are more prone to certain types of delays. This
analysis will inform potential strategies for mitigating delays and
improving the TTC’s operational efficiency.</p>
<p>The OpenMeteo data contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Hourly temperature data (in
Celsius).</li>
<li><strong>Precipitation:</strong> Hourly precipitation (rain and
snowfall in mm).</li>
</ul>
<p>The data was acquired from the Open-Meteo Archive Data API. The API
was called with the geographical coordinates for Toronto and contains
hourly weather data for the city. The data will be used in a predictive
model to answer Question 2.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<div id="data-acquisition" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Acquisition</h3>
<p>The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from the City of
Toronto Open Data Portal using the Open Data API. The data includes all
recorded subway delays in Toronto for the year 2024, along with the
delay codes, time, location, and other metadata. Additionally, a delay
code definitions dataset was obtained from the same API and this was
merged with the original data to provide description of each delay type.
Weather data was included from the Open-Meteo API as mentioned
above.</p>
<p>The extracted data includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Stamp Information</strong> (Date, Time, Day of Week,
Hour of Delay)</li>
<li><strong>Location Details</strong> (Station, Subway Line, Direction
of Train)</li>
<li><strong>Delay Duration</strong> (Minutes Delayed)</li>
<li><strong>Delay Cause</strong> (Codes and Descriptions)</li>
<li><strong>Subway Car Details</strong> (Vehicle ID)</li>
<li><strong>Weather Data</strong> (Temperature, Precipitation)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning-and-wrangling" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Cleaning and Wrangling</h3>
<p>Several process steps were applied to clean and prepare the data for
analysis.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Filtering Out Non-Delays and Multi-Station Delays</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some records had a delay of 0 minutes (or None). We are not
interested in these incidents as they do not actually effect commute
times for riders. This removed many of the columns with missing
values.</li>
<li>Some delays were TTC wide or spanned multiple stations. We did not
include these as there is no way to pinpoint the cause of these delays.
This was done using REGEX to remove values that included “TO”, “TOWARD”,
or “-”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Handling Missing Values:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The rest of the columns with missing information were removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Column Type Formatting:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Minutes Delayed was a char column, this was converted to
int</li>
<li>The Time column was originally formatted as <strong>HH:MM</strong>
and was converted to hms.</li>
<li>The Date column was converted from a character to Datetime.</li>
<li>An extra categorical column was added, distinguishing between peak
and non-peak times.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Merging Delay Codes Information</strong>
<ul>
<li>The delay codes were matched with their corresponding descriptions
from the delay code definitions dataset.</li>
<li>The weather data at the time of each delay was also included. The
data for the exact time is not the data set, however, it could be merged
based on the floor of the delay time (if the delay happened at 4:24 PM,
we got the weather data for 4:00 PM).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Erroneous Data and Outliers</strong>
<ul>
<li>There is some data that was incorrectly inputted. One such example
is that Warden station is once listed as being on the Yonge-University
Line when it is actually on the Bloor-Danforth Line.</li>
<li>There is a delay that lasted 6 hours that started at 4am. This is a
massive outlier that is not a common occurrence (or even happened a
second time). We can ignore this point as it is not indicative of any
trends that we are trying to find.</li>
<li>Stations along the Sheppard line were not included as there are not
enough observations to make significant conclusions about any
results.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>There are 9178 observations and 16 variables for each
observation.</p>

<p>From this, we can see that Kipling, Bloor, Kennedy, Eglinton, Finch,
St George, and VMC stations have the highest number of delays. These are
all either transfer stations or are terminal stations (with the
exception of Eglinton which is one of the busiest stations and the site
of a future transfer station). We can also see that more
Yonge-University line stations have have a large amount of delays,
Kipling and Kennedy, which are are on the BD line have the most and
third most delays. We can further look into this by exploring the types
of delays that are occurring at stations.</p>

<p>The top reasons for subway delays in Toronto seem to be
passenger-related incidents, with “Disorderly Patron” being the most
frequent cause, accounting for 157 delays with an average delay of 6.85
minutes. Other notable causes include Passenger Assistance Alarm
Activation (72 delays, 4.11 min avg) and OPTO (COMMS) Train Door
Monitoring (50 delays, 6.9 min avg).</p>
<p>We can also look at which delays took the most time total:</p>

<p>The top delay causes by total delay time highlight disorderly patrons
as the most significant issue, causing over 1,000 minutes of delays
throughout the year. Other major contributors include unauthorized
people at track level, and injured or ill customers, each accumulating
several hundred minutes of delays. Passenger-related incidents,
including assaults, alarms, and other disruptions, collectively
contribute to substantial downtime. The difference we see with this and
the last visualization is that a few of the most commonly occurring
delays, such as the passenger alarm being activated and unsanitary
vehicle are not in the top 10 of total delay time since the average time
for those delays is much less.</p>
<p>Finally, we can view the occurrence of delays distributed by the time
of day at which they occur.</p>

<p>There is no data for 3 and 4 am as the subway is closed for those
hours. There is a major peak in the number of delays during the
afternoon (between 2 and 4 pm), with the highest delays occurring around
3pm. What is interesting is that while the number of delays is much
higher during peak hours, the average time of each delay is almost the
same.</p>
<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This analysis of TTC subway delays has provided several key insights
into delay causes, timing patterns, and station-specific trends. The
most frequent delay and the delay that has wasted the most amount of
time this year is <strong>Disorderly Patrons</strong>, accounting for
157 recorded delays and taking a total of 1075.45 hours, much more than
any other delay type. Other common delay types include passenger
assistance alarms being activated, train door monitoring issues, and
medical emergencies. However, when examining total delay time,
disruptions such as unauthorized people at track level and injured or
ill customer incidents accumulate significantly more system downtime,
despite occurring less frequently.</p>
<p>in terms of time-based patters, delays are more frequent during peak
hours (7-9 AM, 3-7 PM) when the TTC is running more trains, with a
noticeable spike at 3 PM. Interestingly, while peak hours have more
delays, the average duration of each delay is similar to non-peak
periods, suggestions that the nature of delays remains relatively
consistent through the day. Additionally, certain stations such as
Kipling, Bloor, Kennedy and Finch experience the highest number of
delays, many of which are near major transfer or terminal stations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="question-2-predictive-modelling" class="section level1">
<h1>Question 2: Predictive Modelling</h1>
<p>In the second phase of this project, I aim to develop and compare
multiple predictive models to estimate the duration of subway delays
across Toronto’s TTC system. Building on prior exploratory findings, the
objective is to quantify how factors such as time of day, subway line,
station location, day of the week, and delay cause influence delay
duration.</p>
<p>The response variable will be delay duration (in minutes). Predictor
variables will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temporal Variables:</strong> Hour of the day, peak
vs. non-peak, day of the week</li>
<li><strong>Spatial Variables:</strong> Station name, subway line</li>
<li><strong>Incident Characteristics:</strong> Delay cause (Passenger
Related vs Non-Passenger Related)</li>
</ul>
<p>I will implement a variety of regression models including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear Regression</strong> (as a baseline)</li>
<li><strong>Generalized Additive Models</strong> (to capture non-linear
temporal effects)</li>
<li><strong>Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Models</strong> (to
capture interactions and complex dependencies)</li>
</ul>
<p>Model performance will be evaluated using <strong>RMSE</strong>,
<strong>MAE</strong>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\textbf{R^2}\)</span> metrics on a holdout test
set (80/20 split). This comparative analysis will identify the most
suitable approach for forecasting subway delay durations and inform
operational decision-making for delay mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>We start by fitting a linear regression model as a baseline. Then, a
Generalized Linear Model (GAM) is fit. We will have a smoothing factor
on Hour since time-of-day effects can be non-linear as well as
precipitation, since heavy rainfall and snowfall might have an
exponentially larger effect. We will reduce the model to incorporate
only significant variables. Finally, we will implement and compare
several regression models using historical TTC delay data. Specifically,
I will fit a linear regression, a generalized additive model (GAM), a
random forest, and an XGBoost regressor, using predictors such as time
of day, precipitation, station, subway line, day of the week, delay
type, and peak hour classification. Model performance will be evaluated
using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics on a held-out test set. This comparative
analysis will identify the most accurate and robust modeling approach
for understanding and forecasting subway delays.</p>

<p>Each model was trained on a consistent set of predictors including
time of day, precipitation, station, line, day of the week, incident
type, and peak vs. non-peak designation. Performance was assessed on a
held-out test set using three standard regression metrics: Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R².</p>
<p>Among the models, the Random Forest achieved the best overall
performance with the lowest RMSE (6.2582) and highest R² (0.0120),
indicating slightly better predictive accuracy and explanatory power
compared to the others. The GAM and Linear Regression models produced
very similar results, suggesting that delay duration may have limited
nonlinearity or that the key nonlinear effects are already captured by
categorical variables. Surprisingly, XGBoost, despite its typical
performance advantages on structured data, underperformed in this case,
yielding the highest RMSE (6.3422) and lowest R² (0.0063).</p>
<p>The predicted vs. actual scatter plots further illustrate these
findings. All models show a strong clustering of points in the 0–10
minute range, where the majority of delays occur, but consistently
underpredict longer delays. This is evident from the downward curvature
below the ideal prediction line (red dashed), especially in the 15–40
minute range, suggesting that none of the models fully captured the
drivers of extreme delay events. The Random Forest plot demonstrates
slightly better spread along the diagonal, but the overall prediction
quality remains limited.</p>
<div id="feature-importance" class="section level2">
<h2>Feature Importance</h2>
<p>To better understand which factors most strongly influence subway
delay duration predictions, feature importance was extracted from the
Random Forest and XGBoost models.
<img src="Toronto-Subway-Delay-Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="960" /><img src="Toronto-Subway-Delay-Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-2.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>In the Random Forest model, the top contributing features were
specific stations, with Warden Station and Kennedy BD Station ranking
highest. This suggests that certain stations may be systematically more
prone to longer delays. Additionally, passenger-related incidents,
precipitation, and Sunday delays also appeared as important predictors,
highlighting both spatial and temporal influences on delay severity.</p>
<p>In contrast, the XGBoost model placed overwhelming emphasis on
precipitation, identifying it as the dominant predictor of delay
duration. Station effects were present but less pronounced, with
Yorkdale, Warden, and Keele among the top-ranked. Notably, incident
type, hour of day, and day of week played a smaller role.</p>
<p>These differing importance profiles highlight how model architecture
affects variable interpretation: Random Forests tend to capture strong
categorical interactions (e.g., specific stations), while XGBoost may
better exploit numerical gradients like precipitation. The convergence
around precipitation, stations, and incident type across both models
suggests these are key factors shaping subway delay behavior.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on the models developed in this analysis, we can estimate the
duration of subway delays using predictors such as station location,
time of day, day of week, incident type, and precipitation. However, the
overall predictive accuracy is limited. All four models—Linear
Regression, GAM, Random Forest, and XGBoost—produced relatively low R²
values (all below 0.02), indicating that the current set of predictors
explains only a small portion of the variability in delay duration.</p>
<p>While tree-based models like Random Forest performed slightly better
in terms of RMSE and variable importance analysis revealed that
precipitation, specific stations, and passenger-related incidents were
consistently influential, all models struggled to predict longer or
outlier delays. The clustering of predictions in the 0–10 minute range
and the underestimation of extreme delays suggest that important
explanatory factors may be missing, such as real-time ridership levels,
operational disruptions, or special events.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although it is possible to estimate delay durations to
a limited degree using the available predictors, the low explanatory
power indicates that more granular or contextual data is needed to build
reliable and actionable prediction models.</p>
